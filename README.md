# 4x4-RAM-Design-using-74xx-Series-ICs
4×4 RAM implemented using basic logic ICs: 74175 quad D flip-flops (x3) for storage, 74139 (1×4 decoder) for write selection, 74153 (4×1 MUX, x4) for read access, and 7408 (quad AND gate) for control logic. A fundamental project demonstrating memory design with discrete TTL components.
